'''
1)	The Users table stores information about sellers and buyers, namely: [username, name, email, password] that are chosen by the user himself along with a [user id] assigned by the code (auto incrementing integer) and [status] which is also set by the codes. The status is online when the client logs in and offline otherwise. 
Note: the username is unique and two different users can not have the same username. If a user tries to register (sign up) with a username already taken, the program will prompt them to choose another username. Additionally, a mail can be used only once, meaning that after a user registered with a mail, this mail cannot be used again for another account.

2)	The Products table stores information about products added into the AUBoutique, namely: [product name, description of the product, price, image of the product] which are set by the sellers along with [product id] and [status] which are assigned by the program. 
Note: The product id is an auto incrementing integer which is unique for each product added. The unique ID prevents confusion between products with the same name and we do not need to provide too many details when buying one product. Instead, we only provide the ID of the object instead. For the status, it indicates if the object is sold or available.
